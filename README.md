# Chive Mobile Application - Front End

This project is a hybrid mobile application for both iOS and Android devices developed with Ionic 3 and the MEAN Stack. The app is a recipe book which allows users to store their recipes safely on their devices.

## Introduction
**Chive** is the end of year project developed by myself and [Keith Daly](https://github.com/dalykeith) for our third year of Software Development in GMIT. The app itself is a recipe collection app. The aim of this project was to use knowledge collected over our last three years in college and apply it to learning a suite of new technologies. Primarly the *MEAN stack*, comprised of **MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js** and **Node.js**. There are two parts to **Chive**, the frontend mobile application developed in *Ionic* and the backend with a common *RESTful API*.
