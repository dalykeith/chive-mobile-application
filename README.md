# Chive Mobile Application - Front End

This project is a hybrid mobile application for both iOS and Android devices developed with Ionic 3 and the MEAN Stack. The app is a recipe book which allows users to store their recipes safely on their phones.

## Introduction
Chive is the end of year project developed by myself and [Keith Daly](https://github.com/dalykeith) for our third year of Software Development in GMIT. The aim of this project was to use knowledge collected over our last three years in college and apply it to learning a suite of new technologies. Primarly the MEAN stack, comprised of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js. There are two parts to **Chive**, the frontend mobile application developed in Ionic and the backend with a common RESTful API.
